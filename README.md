# parking_garage_rangers

Me and Erin absolutely killed the teamwork game. We were constantly talking with one another on how to approach any of the issues that were were facing, 
and we always made sure to be avaliable for one another.
I created the repo for us to work on the project together. 
Erin created an outline for the dictionary and how we wanted to approach every element that we needed for the project.
She focused on the inputs for the "tickets" and "payment" methods.
I worked on the "leaving Grarage" portion for the user to finish their purchases
We evenly distributed the workload for how function were looped to their respective counterparts.
Bsically a Kobe-Shaq teamwork
